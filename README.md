# Tic-Tac-Toe
Two players face off in a 1v1 of Tic Tac Toe. To determine who goes first, two players will guess a number from one to 100 and the person who gets the closest number to randomized number will start first. After finishing the game, the program will ask to continue playing or not and restart the program if the two players want to keep playing.
